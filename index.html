                    So, what is Copyright? And how does it differ from Plagiarism? Well, both involve 
                    stealing someone else's work as your own. For example, if you take a TV character 
                    and use it for your own profit, that is illegal by copyright. If you take someone's 
                    words and research and pass it off as your own, that is academic dishonesty, or
                    plagiarism. The main difference is that copyright is illegal, and applies to works 
                    like music, games, etc. Plagiarism is not illegal, and applies mostly to words from 
                    others, such as quotes, research, or otherwise.
